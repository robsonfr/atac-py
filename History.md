# Technical High School #

Back in 1993, I studied at ETE (now ETEC) "Lauro Gomes", a technical high school that has regular classes (math, biology, physics, etc.) and also **technical** classes. In my course (Data Processing) we had programming classes, accounting, management, among others.

# Programming Class Assignment #

In 1994 - after studying BASIC - we started programming classes with the Pascal programming language. That year "Lauro Gomes" school had celebrated its 30th anniversary. Thus, all students were invited to provide something to praise our school.

My programming teacher at the time was a Japanese-Brazilian woman called _Rosinha_ (little Rose). She requested a program, written in Pascal. At the time, I was a self-taught C programmer. Since Turbo Pascal libraries
were very similar to Turbo C libraries, I decided to write a **videogame** in C instead of Pascal.

# The Team #

Our class was split in teams. In my team there were two of my friends: Roger Alvarenga and Ricardo S. Silva. They played the early versions of the game and provided some tips and enhancements.
