Based on ATAC-C - a 1994 high school project - this project is a classic shoot'em up game. Since the 1994 original source code is lost, this new version was designed by reverse engineering the executable binaries running on DOSBox.

This game features basic graphics and sound (contribuitions are welcome!), and it's been written in Python, using the Pygame module.
